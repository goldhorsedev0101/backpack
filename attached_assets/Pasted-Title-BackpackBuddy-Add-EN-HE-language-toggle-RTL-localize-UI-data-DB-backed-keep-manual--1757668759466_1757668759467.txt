Title: BackpackBuddy — Add EN/HE language toggle (RTL), localize UI & data (DB-backed), keep manual planner intact

Goal:
Add a fast Language toggle (English ⇄ Hebrew) that switches all UI labels (i18n) and loads localized data from Supabase with fallback (EN→HE). Hebrew must render RTL. My Trips save/merge/editor continue to work on the same tables.

Do (don’t ask):

UI i18n & toggle

Integrate i18n (e.g., react-i18next) with two resources: en and he.

Add a Language button in the global header: EN | HE. Persist choice to localStorage and default from browser locale.

When language is he, set dir="rtl" on <html> or a top-level wrapper and flip layout safely (no visual breaks).

Move all hardcoded UI strings to translation files. All new texts in English & Hebrew.

Dates/Numbers

Use locale-aware formatting (Day.js/Intl) — pick locale by current i18n language.

Verify planner’s date/time pickers show Hebrew weekdays/months when HE.

Data localization (read path)

Prefer translation tables (below) via Supabase: when fetching destinations / attractions / restaurants / accommodations:

Try to fetch the requested locale (e.g., he);

If not found, fallback to English;

Never break UI if translation is missing.

Provide selectors in the data-access layer: getDestinations(locale), getAttractions(locale), etc., implementing the fallback.

Plan JSON / My Trips

plan_json remains language-agnostic for structure, but store display fields optionally per-locale inside plan_json.meta (if needed), without breaking existing saves.

Saving/Merging/Reordering behavior remains unchanged.

RTL polish

Ensure grid/list layouts, icons, and arrows are mirrored where appropriate when dir="rtl".

Verify drag & drop still works correctly in RTL.

Deliverables

Code changes with a diff summary (files touched + purpose).

Two screenshots:

EN UI (header + /my-trips)

HE UI (header + /my-trips, RTL)

Short note explaining how locale is persisted and how data fallback works.

Acceptance:

Clicking Language switches the whole app instantly (UI strings + data labels).

Hebrew renders RTL cleanly; no broken layouts.

Data shows in Hebrew where available, otherwise English, with no errors.

My Trips save/merge/editor keep working unchanged.
